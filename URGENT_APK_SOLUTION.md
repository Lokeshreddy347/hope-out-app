# 🚨 URGENT: Get Your Hope Out APK - Step by Step Solution

## 🎯 **The Problem**
Flutter's Gradle cache is locked by running processes. This is a common Windows issue.

## 🚀 **SOLUTION 1: Restart & Build (Most Likely to Work)**

### **Step 1: Complete Restart**
1. **Close ALL applications** (VS Code, browsers, everything)
2. **Restart your computer completely**
3. **Don't open anything else first**

### **Step 2: Build APK**
1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**
   - Press `Windows + X`
   - Select "Command Prompt (Admin)" or "PowerShell (Admin)"

2. **Navigate to your project:**
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\iloke\OneDrive\Desktop\project\flutter_pro_test"
   ```

3. **Build the APK:**
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --debug
   ```

4. **Wait patiently** (may take 5-10 minutes)

## 🛠️ **SOLUTION 2: Use Android Studio (Backup Plan)**

### **Step 1: Open Android Studio**
1. **Launch Android Studio**
2. **Open an Existing Project**
3. **Navigate to:** `C:\Users\iloke\OneDrive\Desktop\project\flutter_pro_test`

### **Step 2: Build APK**
1. **Go to Build menu** → **Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** → **Build APK(s)**
2. **Wait for build to complete**
3. **Click "locate" when build finishes**

## 🔧 **SOLUTION 3: Copy Project to New Location**

If the above fails, the issue might be with OneDrive sync:

### **Step 1: Copy Project**
1. **Copy entire project folder** to `C:\temp\hope_out\`
2. **Make sure it's NOT in OneDrive folder**

### **Step 2: Build from New Location**
1. **Open Command Prompt as Admin**
2. **Navigate to:** `cd C:\temp\hope_out\`
3. **Run:** `flutter pub get`
4. **Run:** `flutter build apk --debug`

## 📱 **SOLUTION 4: Use Online Build Service (If All Else Fails)**

### **GitHub Actions (Free)**
1. **Create GitHub account** (if you don't have one)
2. **Upload your project** to GitHub
3. **I'll help you set up automatic APK builds**

### **Codemagic (Free tier)**
1. **Go to:** https://codemagic.io
2. **Sign up with GitHub**
3. **Connect your repository**
4. **Build APK in the cloud**

## 🎯 **Expected APK Location**

Once successful, find your APK at:
